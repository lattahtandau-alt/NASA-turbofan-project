# NASA-turbofan-project
Build a reusable, function-based sensor data cleaning pipeline that can be configured for different datasets, then demonstrate it on the NASA turbofan dataset by identifying the sensors most indicative of degradation. The analysis layer is intentionally dataset-specific, to allow future reuse of the cleaning pipeline.
